As a Facilitator of my college for <b>Google's</b>, Applied CS with Android, this repository holds all the code and memories made during the flipped classroom program days in AEC. It is the passion that makes it worth it to live the experience of coding and forming beautiful solutions out of it. We formed a family " Applied CS" family, a strong bond and connection cherishing goodwill and support. It is the inner drive that we have, to achieve what we do.

I have a blog post [here [will update later]]() about my experience at <b>Google, Bangalore</b> . Also, do check out the videos :)

We hosted 2 weeks of sessions, on Applied CS with Android in AEC. In the first week of session, we covered 5 apps followed by a CODESPRINT:
    
    1. Anagrams
    2. Scarne's Dice
    3. Word Ladder
    4. Black Hole 
    5. Puzzle 8

In the second week of session, we covered other 5 apps followed by a CODESPRINT : [ Not conducted till 2 Feb 2018, will update ]

    1. Word Stack
    2. Binary Search Tree Viewer
    3. Ghost I
    4. Ghost II
    5. Continental Divide 
    
It was fun, memorable and at the same time pretty exciting to learn the most used Data Structure and Algorithms. Thank you <b>Google</b>, for providing such an opportunity to connect and learn.

GETTING STARTED
-

Setting Up Android Studio , syncing build/gradle is the most time consuming thing in the workshop. It downloads & downloads ....& downloads dependencies. Slow Internet Connection, might be Fatal to time ! :D . In the meantime , We looked at <b>MIT App Inventor</b>, explained how easy it is to build Android Apps in MIT App inventor. I have a repository [here](https://github.com/SKKSaikia/MIT-App-Inventor) outlining the works done.
