As a Facilitator of my college for <b>Google's</b>, Applied CS witH Android, this repository holds all the code and memories made during the flipped classroom program days in AEC. It is the passion that makes it worth it to live the experience of coding and forming beautiful solutions outof it. We formed a family " Applied CS" family, a strong bond and connection cherishing goodwill and support. It was the inner drive that we did, what we did.

I have a blog post here about my experience to <b>Google, Bangalore</b> . Also, do check out the videos :)
