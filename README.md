As a Facilitator of my college for <b>Google's</b>, Applied CS with Android, this repository holds all the code and memories made during the flipped classroom program days in AEC. It is the passion that makes it worth it to live the experience of coding and forming beautiful solutions out of it. We formed a family " Applied CS" family, a strong bond and connection cherishing goodwill and support. It was the inner drive that we had, to achieve what we did.

I have a blog post here about my experience at <b>Google, Bangalore</b> . Also, do check out the videos :)

We hosted 2 sessions of Applied CS in AEC. In the first session, we covered 5 apps followed by a codesprint:
    
    1. Anagrams
    2. Scarne's Dice
    3. Word Ladder
    4. Black Hole 
    5. Puzzle 8

In the second session, we covered other 5 apps apps followed by a codesprint:

    1. Anagrams
    2. WordStack
    3. Ghost I
    4. Ghost II
    5. Continental Divide 
    
It was fun, memorable and at the same time pretty exciting to learn the most used Data Structure and Algorithms. Thank you <b>Google</b>, for providing such opportunity to connect and learn.
