Applied CS with Android @ AEC

Applied CS( Android ) and Java is completely new in AEC ( 2017-18 ), though we did not left any chance to learn. We agree that due to less class strength with only upto 18-20 per batch of Computer Science , we had to struggle a lot to learn. Less developer communities around and less resources did not stop us, we believe that we got the best out of it. 

Those who attended the workshop ( flipped classroom program),  had an inner drive to learn and share. We believe this is the genesis of a programming community here [ Dec 2017 ]. This is exciting. 

Data Structures and the Algorithms were the most exciting content to learn, we gradually learned together to implement the logic. We had to take a lot of help from online resources and put in lot of effort. We tried, but if we really got stuck after several tries, we had to look up similar codes.I wish I can credit the authors but I didnt keep track of [ You may find portions of code similar, but we learned from you. Thank you !]. We reviewed the concepts again and again.  


That Aha! moment when you get something working is genuinely beautiful. To genuinely learn programming from the core, we formed a little group among ourself, who now meets regularly after class and discusses different Data Structure & Algorithms & exciting topics. This we call the class-X, where we regularly meet ( The Applied CS participants ). We reviewed [ All the 10 Apps, the DS and Algo's involved and what each piece of code does to complete the logic ] and now we regularly meet to extend our knowledge. " Applied CS " ,  Thank You. Hope to see you in campus again :)
